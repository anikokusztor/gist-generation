# Gist generation experiment using Inquisit 5

This is the main directory that contains all the necessary Inquisit files to run the gist generation experiment.

## Pre-requisites

### Software

* Inquisit Lab 5 installed on your machine (I am using version 5.0.14.0 on Mac OS) - there is another way to access Inquisit using [Monash vLab](https://www.monash.edu/research-portal/vlab/applications/inquisit/inquisit-lab) but could be slower and exchange files between the virtual machine and local could be cumbersome. [Monash Research Portal](https://www.monash.edu/research-portal/vlab/applications/inquisit) also contains information about Inquisit installation.

* Get a licence for Inquisit Lab - once installed, follow the instructions to get a registration key.

### Information about Inquisit



### Steps to run the experiment using Inquisit Lab (local - not integrated with MTurk)
